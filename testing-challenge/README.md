# TDD challenge

Clone this repo into your html folder, and run `composer install` to get PHPUnit installed.

This repo contains a set of unit tests for a user validator class, as well as an empty class ready for you to edit.

Start by looking at the first test, and then write the coded needed to make that test pass. Once you have a test passing, move onto the next test! Try to avoid the temptation to write loads of code before running the tests, the best way to work is to just focus on getting 1 test to pass at a time.
